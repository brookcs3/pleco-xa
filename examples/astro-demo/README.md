# Astro Scroll Doppler Demo

This minimal example shows the scroll-driven doppler effect built with Astro.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser and scroll to fade between `loop1.mp3` and `loop2.mp3`. Place the audio files in the `public` folder.
