# Astro Doppler Demo

This example recreates the scroll-based crossfading demo using Astro. Place `loop1.mp3` and `loop2.mp3` in the `public` directory, then run `npm run dev` from this folder after installing Astro:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to test the scroll-driven audio transition.
